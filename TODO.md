# TODOs
A list of things to make my dotfiles more awesomer. A âœ“  indicates done and crossed out indicates a defunct item.

[Write .md s] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

[ ] install git if not found
[ ] rm zsh from install_packages. and make oh-my-zsh dependant on the success of the installation
[ ] auto-update on login
[ ] [RSS Reader](https://github.com/swanson/stringer)
[ ] brew bundle rbenv
[ ] [TerminalVim.app](http://thepugautomatic.com/2015/02/open-in-iterm-vim-from-finder/)
[x] pre-push brew bundle hook
[ ] vimrc / environment (python, java, bash etc.)
[ ] YouCompleteMe -> brew install cmake && cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe && ./install.py


### Installation sur un nouveau mac
[x] no git, but still going through step (ex: "Installing RCM...")
[x] Homebrew is missing
[ ] Split osx essentials & packages
[ ] adoptoenjdk, torbrowser, horndis failed

### What I had to do for vim to work
- PlugInstall
- install a recent node for cocvim
- install fonts so it's nicely displayed in NERDTree
```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install font-hack-nerd-font
```
